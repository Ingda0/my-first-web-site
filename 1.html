Hello world.
<strong>I'm gonna <u>make</u> it!</strong>
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
<br><br>Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
<p>You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow.
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me, some fine things.
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get.
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone</p>
